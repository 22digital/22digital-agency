## Version 0.2.0 (25/05/2018)

This version isn't functioning. I'm ditching GitHub Pages and moving this to
Heroku. I cannot figure out what is happening with GitHub Pages and why it
won't load `22digital.agency` at all. It works on my localhost but not
in a live, production environment. The next release will be operational
on Heroku.
